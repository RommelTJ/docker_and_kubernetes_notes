# Kubernetes Production Deployment

## The Deployment Process

Google Cloud will cost money. Probably around $50/month.

## Google Cloud vs AWS for Kubernetes

* Why Google Cloud?
  * Google created Kubernetes
  * AWS only "recently" for Kubernetes support
  * Far, far easier to poke around Kubernetes on Google Cloud
  * Excellent documentation for beginners.
