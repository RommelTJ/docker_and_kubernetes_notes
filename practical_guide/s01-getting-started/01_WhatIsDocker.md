# What is Docker

Docker is a container technology. It's a tool for creating and managing containers.

A container is a standardized unit of software.
A package of code and dependencies to run that code (e.g. NodeJS code + NodeJS runtime).

The same container always yields the same application and execution behavior.

Support for containers is built into modern operating systems.
Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.
