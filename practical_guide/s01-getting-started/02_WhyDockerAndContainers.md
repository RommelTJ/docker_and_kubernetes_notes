# Why Containers?

Why would we want independent, standardized "application packages"?

1. We often have different development and production environments.
2. We want to build and test in exactly the same environment as we later run our app in.

1. Different development environments within a team or company.
2. We want all team members to have the exact same environment when working on the same project.

1. Clashing tools / versions between different projects.
2. When switching between projects, tools used in project A should not clash with tools from project B.

## Summary

Three main advantages: 
* Exact same environment for development and production.
* Share a common development environment.
* Don't want to uninstall and reinstall dependencies.
