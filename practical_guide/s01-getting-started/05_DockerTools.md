# Docker Tools

We installed the Docker Engine.  
Docker Desktop makes sure Docker Engine is installed and that everything is setup correctly.  
Docker Hub is a service that allows us to host our images in the cloud.  
Docker Compose is a tool that builds up on docker which makes managing more complex container easier.  
Kubernetes is a tool for managing containerized applications.
