# Sharing Images

## Overview

### Sharing Images and Containers

Everyone who has an image can create containers based on the image!

To share:  
* We can share the Dockerfile  
  Run `docker build .`
  Might need surrounding files / source code
* We can share a built image (like on DockerHub)  
  Download an image, run a container based on it
  No build step required
