# Building Images and Understanding Container Names

If you want help:  
```shell
docker-compose up --help
```

If you want to force rebuild:
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

If you want to just build without starting containers:
```shell
docker-compose build
```

If you want to use the service names as container names use the `container_name` option.
