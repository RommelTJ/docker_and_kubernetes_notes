# Getting Started With Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Issues with Manual Deployment

* Manual Deployment of Containers is hard to maintain, error-prone and annoying
  * Even beyond security and configuration concerns!
* Containers might crash / go down and need to be replaced
* We might need more container instances upon traffic spikes
* Incoming traffic should be distributed equally
